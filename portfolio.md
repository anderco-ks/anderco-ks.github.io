# Karta Solutions Platform
As a full-stack developer for [Karta Solutions](karta.solutions), I helped design and develop a cloud-based web application for 3D virtual trainings. This platform supports and integrates different types of digital assets, including:
* 3D models in most common exchange formats (.gltf, .obj/.mtl, etc.) created either from artistic renderings or reality capture
* 360Â° (Spherical) Images
* GIS data

Along with this, we developed a user-friendly interface, allowing users to customize shareable virtual experiences using drag-and-drop interactions. 

As a member of our Agile development team, I programmed in JavaScript, TypeScript, PL/pgSQL and used tools and frameworks such as Angular, Bootstrap, Three.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express.js, Angular Material, and Mapbox.

*Keywords: Web Application Development, TypeScript, Angular, WebGL*

# Problem Solving with Algorithms
Solved complex problems by using custom algorithm implentations - answers verified as successful implementations by instructors. The problems included:
- [k-palindromes](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-k-palindrome-strings/)
- [pattern match](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/)
- [2D Array Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

*Keywords: Python, Algorithms, BFS, DFS, Greedy, Dynamic Programming*

# Hash Map and MinHeap 
Custom implentation of a minimum heap data structure, built on top of a custom hash map implementation. Verified as a valid implementation by instructors.

*Keywords: Python, Data Structures*

# Travel Tracker
A web application built with JavaScript, Handlebars, Node.js/ Express.js, and MySQL. Focused on database design:
- one-to-many, many-to-many relationships
- constraints
- primary and foreign keys
- stored procedures
- queries
- CRUD operations

*Keywords: JavaScript, CRUD, RESTful API, Relational Databases, SQL* 
# Multi-threaded Data Partitioner
Rust program designed to partition data into equal sizes
* create as many threads as partitions and have them run concurrently
* take intermediate results from each thread
* reduce the data into the final result.

*Keywords: C, Rust, Operating Systems*

# Random Number Sorter/Counter
MASM program that counts, sorts, and analyzes randomized inputs of numbers.

*Keywords: Assembly Language*

# Command-line GO
Python implementation of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)). Run and played in the Python Terminal.

*Keywords: Python, test-driven development*
# Command-line Checkers
Python implentation of Checkers. Run and played in the Python Terminal.

*Keywords: Python, object-oriented programming*
