I'm a full-stack developer / analyst with experience programming with TypeScript / JavaScript, Angular, Node.js / Express.js, and PL/pgSQL. 

In 2020, I co-founded [Karta Solutions](karta.solutions), a software startup based in Anchorage, Alaska. We designed a web platform that provides a customizable virtual training tool for heavy industry use cases.

Previous to 2020, I worked as a part-time analyst at the Center of Applied Software and Systems while attending Oregon State University pursuing my post-baccalaureate degree in Computer Science. 

Before working in software, I taught middle school science and math, both in Alaska and Oregon. 

I received my Masters in Secondary Education in 2018 and Bachelors in Biological Sciences in 2016 from University of Alaska Fairbanks. 

I graduated with the Class of 2012 as valedictorian from Nikiski High School.
